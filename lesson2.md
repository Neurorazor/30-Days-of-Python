Lesson 2: Data Types and Variables in Python

In Python, you can create variables to store different types of data. Here are some of the basic data types in Python:

    Integers: whole numbers, like 3, 7, or -21.
    Floats: numbers with decimal points, like 3.14, 0.5, or -1.0.
    Strings: text data, enclosed in single or double quotes, like "Hello, World!" or 'Python'.
    Booleans: binary values that can be either True or False.

To create a variable in Python, you simply choose a name for it and use the "=" operator to assign a value to it. For example:

python

# Create a variable called "name" and assign it a string value
name = "Alice"

# Create a variable called "age" and assign it an integer value
age = 25

# Create a variable called "is_student" and assign it a boolean value
is_student = True

# Create a variable called "pi" and assign it a float value
pi = 3.14159

You can also use arithmetic operators like +, -, *, and / to perform calculations with numeric variables:

python

# Create two variables and perform arithmetic operations
x = 10
y = 3
z = x + y  # Adds x and y
w = x - y  # Subtracts y from x
q = x * y  # Multiplies x and y
r = x / y  # Divides x by y (returns a float)
s = x // y  # Divides x by y and rounds down to the nearest integer

Updating Git and GitHub Repository

After creating the lesson2.md file and making some changes to the README.md file, you can follow these steps to update the Git and GitHub repository:

    Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the local repository directory.
    Use the "git status" command to see the changes made to the repository.
    Use the "git add ." command to stage all the changes for the commit. If you want to stage only specific changes, you can use "git add <filename>".
    Use the "git commit -m 'commit message'" command to commit the changes with a meaningful commit message.
    Use the "git push" command to push the changes to the GitHub repository.

Here's an example of the commands you can use:

shell

$ cd /path/to/local/repo
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Added lesson2.md and updated README.md"
$ git push

By following these steps, you can easily update your Git and GitHub repository with the latest changes.

That's it for lesson 2! Don't forget to save the lesson2.md file and push the changes to the repository.
