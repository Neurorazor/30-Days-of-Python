In this lesson, you'll learn how to print "Hello, World!" in Python...

Lesson 1: Printing Text

In this lesson, you'll learn how to print text to the console using the print() function.

    Open Visual Studio Code and create a new file by clicking "File" > "New File".
    Save the file as helloworld.py in a directory of your choice.
    In the file, add the following code:

python

print("Hello, world!")

    Save the file.
    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where helloworld.py is located.
    Run the following command to execute the script:

bash

python helloworld.py

You should see the text "Hello, world!" printed to the console.

    Next, initialize a Git repository in the directory where your helloworld.py file is located. You can do this by opening the terminal in VS Code and running the following command:

bash

git init

This will create a new Git repository in the current directory.

    Add helloworld.py to the Git repository by running the following command in the terminal:

bash

git add helloworld.py

This will stage your file for commit.

    Commit your changes to Git by running the following command in the terminal:

bash

git commit -m "Add 'Hello, world!' message"

This will commit your changes to Git with a commit message explaining what changes you made.

    Finally, push your changes to a remote Git repository. If you don't have a remote repository set up yet, you can create a new repository on a hosting platform like GitHub or GitLab, and then follow their instructions for pushing your changes. Here's an example command for pushing your changes to a remote repository:

bash

git push origin master

This will push your changes to a remote repository on the master branch.

Congratulations! You've learned how to print text to the console using Python, and how to manage your code changes using Git in VS Code.
